## About

A convolutional neural network (CNN) model is designed to segment brain tumors from 2D Magnetic Resonance (MR) images. The model takes MR images as input 
and processes them through multiple convolutional layers to capture spatial features. It then uses these features to differentiate between tumor and non-tumor regions. 
The output is a segmented image highlighting the tumor areas, aiding in accurate and efficient diagnosis.
